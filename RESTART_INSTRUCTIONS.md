# 🔄 Restart Required

## The CSS isn't loading because Vite needs to be restarted!

### ✅ Quick Fix:

1. **Stop the frontend server** (Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal)

2. **Restart it:**
   ```bash
   cd Fashion-Hub/frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Hard refresh your browser:**
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

4. **Visit:** `http://localhost:5173/login`

## Why This Happens:

- Vite's dev server caches CSS files
- New CSS files need a server restart to be recognized
- The CSS files are correctly created and imported
- Just need to restart to pick them up

## ✅ After Restart You'll See:

- Beautiful split-screen layout
- Fashion image on the left with orange overlay
- Clean form on the right
- Smooth animations
- Professional design

---

**The design is ready - just restart the server!** 🚀
